### Overview

The Open Payments data set contains records of payments made by drug and medical device companies to physicians, non-physician practitioners (NPPs), and teaching hospitals. It was created by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to meet the criteria established in the [Physician Payment Sunshine Act](https://www.advamed.org/legal/physician-payments-sunshine-act/). Those on the receiving end of the transaction, referred to as the covered recipients, have the opportunity to review payments related to them before the data is made public, but although this review is encouraged, it is not mandatory.
