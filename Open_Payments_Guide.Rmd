### Overview

The Open Payments data set contains records of payments made by drug and medical device companies to physicians, non-physician practitioners (NPPs), and teaching hospitals. It was created by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to meet the criteria established in the [Physician Payment Sunshine Act](https://www.advamed.org/legal/physician-payments-sunshine-act/). This act aims to increase the transparency in the United States healthcare system by publicly documenting financial ties between medical practitioners or facilities and drug and device companies. These ties have been extremely prevalent for over a decade: a survey conducted in 2009 using a stratified random sample of primary care providers and specialists revealed the percentage of physicians with any type of industry relationship was 84% ([Source](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/226207)). Beyond transparency, mandating disclosure is intended to discourage inappropriate relationships and provide a system of accountability ([Source](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/open-payments-user-guide-reporting-entities.pdf)).

### Details on the Production of the Data

Reporting entities include applicable manufacturers as well as group purchasing organizations, which are implicated in the sale of a covered product and must meet some additional criteria ([Source](https://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/Program-Participants/Reporting-Entities)). This definition encapsulates entities arranging pharmaceutical contracts not exclusively for the entity itself, as well as physician-owned distributors of medical devices. 

All covered products must be reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) ([Source](https://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/Program-Participants/Reporting-Entities)). For a  drug or biological to be covered, it must require a prescription or doctor’s authorization to be given. For a device or medical supply to be covered, it must require premarket approval or premarket notification by the FDA.

 By law, these reporting entities must disclose any transfers of value they make to covered recipients, which, as of January 2021, includes physicians, teaching hospitals, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives. The 2021 criteria for covered recipients represents a change from previous years in the expansion to include non-physician providers ([Source](https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/about/glossary)). 

The data submission process occurs online. To submit their transfers of value, reporting entities must log into a [portal](https://portal.cms.gov/portal/) where they can fill out the required information. Extensive documentation is available to reporting entities, including a 375 page [user guide](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/open-payments-user-guide-reporting-entities.pdf) that provides background on the program and its intentions as well as the technical details of filling out the form. 

e Drug Name and National Drug Code (NDC) Reference Data is a reference tool for Applicable Manufacturers and Applicable Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs),

Transfers of value can take a variety of forms ([Source](https://www.advamed.org/legal/physician-payments-sunshine-act/)). Consulting fees are common due to the need for medical expertise in the development of medical products to ensure these products are beneficial in clinical settings, and honoraria are often paid when a medical practitioner shares their expertise at a conference. A central form of financial ties is through research grants and payments, where medical providers are compensated for their role in the research and development process, which is generally time intensive. Education on the utilization of a newly developed device is another transfer of value, and is often required by the FDA. Beyond training, providers may participate in events designed to teach others about the device or contribute to educational materials on the device. Additionally, providers acting as innovators also may be granted royalties to compensate them for their product development ideas. These examples are a subset of all possible transfers of values, but demonstrate the extent to which financial ties are woven into our medical infrastructure in the United States.
 
These transfers of value are collected throughout the entire calendar year, and then data from the previous year must be submitted by reporting entities between February 1st and March 31st ([Source](https://www.cms.gov/openpayments)). Data review occurs from April 1st to May 30th; covered recipients have the opportunity to review payments related to them before the data is made public, but although this review is encouraged, it is not mandatory. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid services does not mediate disputes, so it is up to the covered recipient and reporting entity to come to a resolution ([Source](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/physician-and-teaching-hospital-review-and-dispute-tutorial.pdf)). If the dispute is resolved in the review period, the corrected data will be published in the initial publication, but if the dispute is not resolved in this time frame, the transaction is marked as disputed in the initial publication. Corrections made after the review period are not visible in the initial publication but are made available the following year. The data are released to the public by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid services (accessible at OpenPaymentsData.cms.gov) for the initial publication by June 30th.
